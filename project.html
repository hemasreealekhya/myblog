                   languages. Now-a-days searching for a code on specific topic has become a task. We have to refer many websites to get a code in 
                   specific language. This platform caters to beginners seeking fundamental knowledge, intermediate learners aiming to expand their
                    skills, and professionals striving to stay abreast of industry trends. This platform consists of the code in many different

                     By developing this platform it makes easier for the users to access the code in the specific language.
                      A user can directly access this website for any code in any language rather than searching for it in many websites. 
                This project makes the user work easy to access any code. This project is based on the domain of web development.  </P>
